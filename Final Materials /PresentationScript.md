## SLIDE 1 - TITLE
The question that we decided to chase down is a simple one - is the meteorological region known as “Tornado Alley” moving from its historical position? We are team Tornado Alleycats, and the answer is quite interesting. 

## SLIDE 2 - MAP AND INTRO
A bit of background, //, Tornado Alley is a region of the central contiguous United States that sees more Tornadoes than any other region on Earth. If this body of tornado formation is moving, that should put where it's moving in considerable danger. So, is it moving?

## SLIDE 3 - THE ONE THAT SAYS YES REALLY BIG
In short, // yes. But there’s more to it. 

## SLIDE 4 - CENTROID ZOOM OUT
Leveraging data from NOAA, we studied some 75,000 tornadoes that spawned from 1950 to 2023. We plotted the centroid of each of these tornadoes on a map of the US partitioned by the rank on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Most tornadoes’ centroids are moving East, but stronger tornadoes tend to also have a southward vector. Stronger tornadoes are less frequent, which explains the extreme variance in strong tornadoes. These are just the plotted centroids, not the areas of highest risk, but if you are thinking of moving to Western Tennessee, you may want to reconsider

## SLIDE 6 - SEASONAL CHARTS
Tornadoes in the United States can happen at any time of the year, but generally occur during the Spring season, from March to May. While more Tornadoes are forming every year, the Spring season is increasing faster than any other season when grouped by decade. We used a Linear Regression to predict that the US will see around 1400 tornadoes in the spring seasons of the 2020 decade. Despite this increase in the number of tornadoes, there is a counterintuitive decline // in the number of casualties *caused* by tornadoes. Casualties are here defined as deaths and injuries directly or indirectly caused by tornadoes. Even with the exceptionally violent 2011 season, spring casualties have been dropping fast since the 1950s and have decreased or remained non-increasing for every other season. 

But how is it possible for there to be more tornadoes but fewer casualties, especially when they're forming in a part of the country that hasn't seen nearly as many as they are now?

## SLIDE 7 - THE HYPOTHESIS
Our hypothesis is that something about this East-Southeastwardly migration is causing the energy that would form tornadoes to // “shatter” larger tornadoes into "clusters" of smaller tornadoes. For example, instead of a single EF5 tornado forming, we would expect to see a cluster EF1 and EF2 tornadoes instead. The consequence of this “shattering” on casualties is exponential: 1x EF5 tornado has 300 fold the destructive potential of 5x EF1s. If tornado-forming energy is "shattering" into several smaller tornadoes "clusters", we might have an answer. 

## SLIDE 8 - CLUSTERING
We borrowed our definition of a "cluster" of tornadoes from NOAA researcher Andrew Dean. Say a tornado lands in Joplin, Missouri. If another tornado lands within 40km of that tornado within 24 hours, those two are considered to be within a cluster. We’ve seen a steady, if somewhat seasonal, increase in clustered tornadoes since we started recording these data. Since the migration started, tornado intensities have not clustered in equal share. Around the 1980s, EF1 tornadoes started to occupy the majority of tornadoes forming in clusters leading into their overwhelming share today.

## SLIDE 10 - SHATTER AND CLUSTER EFFECTS
Generally speaking, a tornado of intensity EFX will have twice the destructive potential of an EFX-1. If we are seeing an increase in EF1 tornadoes "shattering" the energy needed to form EF3+ tornadoes, we should anticipate far fewer casualties, so long as the pattern continues. This does not prevent the possibility of extreme events, like the 2011 super outbreak, but the likelihood of single extremely intense tornadoes is decreasing. 

All of this should be couched in the obvious - we are not experts. This is about 9 days of research and extrapolation. These findings are largely corollary, listen to experts. Tornadoes are still extraordinarily dangerous, no matter what the general descriptive data say.

## SLIDE 11 - SUMMARY
To summarize:
* Tornado Alley is indeed moving ESE at about 4.2 miles South per year
* Tornado Alley is producing more tornadoes, but these tornadoes are clustered and weaker than they once were in the 1980s and 1970s
* This hypothetical “shattering” implies that tornadoes stronger than EF3 are going to be much more uncommon than they already were and that casualties brought on by tornadoes may decrease in the coming decades. 
* All of this does not change the fact that tornadoes are still incredibly dangerous events, and we should exercise extreme caution when they are possible, heeding all safety instructions.
